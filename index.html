          Lollipops, licorice, sour candy like sour balls, candy canes, and gummy candy like gummi bears are all free of fat and cholesterol. Since some candy bars can contain up to 30 grams of fat, which is almost all of your daily recommended fat intake for a 1,600 calories diet, going with a lighter candy can satisfy your sweet tooth without busting your belt.

          During World War II, American soldiers were given Tootsie Rolls in their rations because of the candy’s ability to withstand all weather conditions. Considering Tootsie Rolls were invented by an Austrian, Leo Hirshfield, it’s a little ironic.

          All Hershey’s Kisses have a white paper strip that comes out of the top of the wrapper. But do you know what it’s called? This little flag is actually called a “plume.” Hershey’s originally introduced it to distinguish itself from phony knock-off candies.

          The Hershey’s Kiss plume is both functional and fashionable! From 1907 when it was invented, until 1921, Hershey’s Kisses were wrapped by hand. Nowadays, they’re wrapped automatically and every plume is still tucked in with care.

          Hungry? Grab a Snickers. You all probably know that now famous campaign and slogan, but do you know where the name “Snickers” came from? Inventor, Frank Mars, actually had a favorite horse named Snickers. That’s where the idea for this peanutty, caramelly, and chocolatey candy came from. While the horse is long gone, the candy and its name that was created in 1930 lives on!

          We all know kids don’t like green stuff (veggies), but they really seem to enjoy red! In fact, red jelly beans are the all-time favorite jelly bean color among children.

          While we know the color, we don’t know the flavor. One would assume it’s cherry since that’s light and sweet, but there are also dozens of other red jelly bean flavors out there!

          There are Boston Baked Beans, cinnamon jelly beans, pomegranate jelly beans, and so many more. Considering apple juice is one of America’s most popular beverages, maybe there’s a red trend here? Ask your kids and see what they think!

          Ever try to blow a gigantic bubble gum bubble to only have it pop on your face? You might be doing it wrong. In order to blow a huge bubble gum bubble, you need to chew it until all the sugar has dissolved. The reason? Sugar doesn’t stretch! Once the flavor is gone, practice slowly blowing air into the bubble.
          The largest bubble gum bubble recorded to date was 20 inches in diameter. The person used three pieces of Dubble Bubble bubble gum. Now, that’s something to respire to! :)

          During the middle ages, sugar was very expensive, so only the wealthy could afford it. That’s because sugar was originally farmed in India, and only spread to the Middle East and the Mediterranean shortly after. During the 15th century, sugar cost £40.00 per ton!  (a lot for back then).
          A single bag equated to an entire day’s wages! Sugar wasn’t the only modern household item that fetched a large price. In Rome, people used to be paid in salt. So the next time you look at your pantry, appreciate how accessible and affordable these once rare products have become!
